fix-trinity-output v1.0

Trinity outputs fastq files that have been 'corrected'

Unfortunately these files are no longer properly paired and therefore
can't be used in most aligners such as bowtie2 and snap

This script attempts to fix that and produce 2 properly paired fastq
files and a fastq file containing single reads

Options:
  EOS
  opt :left, "fastq file of left reads", :type => String, :required => true
  opt :right, "fastq file of right reads", :type => String, :required => true
  opt :output, "output prefix", :type => String, :required => true
end

left = File.expand_path(opts.left)
right = File.expand_path(opts.right)
if left and right
  if !File.exist?(left)
    Trollop::die "#{left} not found"
  end
  if !File.exist?(right)
    Trollop::die "#{right} not found"
  end
end

fixer = Fixer.new

fixer.run(left, right, opts.output)
